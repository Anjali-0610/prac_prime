            <p class="text">
                SQL injection is a technique used to extract user data by injecting web page inputs as statements through SQL commands. Basically, malicious users can use these instructions to manipulate the applicationâ€™s web server.
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; SQL injection is a code injection technique that can compromise your database.
               <br>
                &#x2022; It is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
               <br>
                &#x2022; It is the injection of malicious code into SQL statements via web page input.
               <br><br>
                         SQL Injection is the main source of web application critical vulnerabilities found globally in 2023, with 23 percent, in addition to 19 percent of internet facing critical vulnerabilities due to cross site scripting (stored) attacks.

                <h2 class="desc"> SCOPE OF WEBSITE</h2>

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Creating a website focused on the prevention of SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) is a valuable and necessary initiative in the realm of web security. Both SQL injection and XSS are common and critical security vulnerabilities that can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and various other malicious activities.
                <br>
                Here's an overview of the scope and key aspects we will be considering :
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; <b>Educational Content:</b> 
                <br>
                               Provide detailed information about SQL injection and XSS, explaining how these attacks work and the potential risks they pose.
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; <b>Testing and Assessment:</b>
                <br>
                               Offer guidelines for conducting security assessments and penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; <b>Prevention Techniques:</b>
                <br>
                               Outline best practices for preventing SQL injection and XSS in web development.
                               Cover parameterized queries, prepared statements, input validation, and output encoding as effective measures against these vulnerabilities.
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; <b>Security Tools:</b>
                <br>
                               Recommend and explain the use of security tools and scanners that can help identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
                               include information on web application firewalls (WAFs) and how they can mitigate SQL injection and XSS attacks.

                    Html, Css, Javascript.
                    Express Js, MongoDB.
                <br><br>
                <b>TECHNIQUES TO PREVENT SQL INJECTION</b>
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; <b>Knuth Morris And Pratt Algorithm</b>  - KMP string matching algorithm is used to compare user;s input string with different SQL injection and XSS attacks patterns that have been formulated.
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; <b>Honey Potting</b>- Mechanism set up to detect, deflect, or study attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. It is essentially a trap designed to attract and identify attackers or malicious activity.
                <br><br>
                &#x2022; <b>JS Validation </b> -  Checking user inputs on a website using JavaScript code to ensure that they meet certain criteria or constraints before being submitted to the server.
