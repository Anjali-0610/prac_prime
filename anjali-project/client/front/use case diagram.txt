use case diagram
Use Case Diagram is a visual representation in Unified Modeling Language (UML) that depicts how users (actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals or perform certain tasks. 

actor 
Actors are external entities that interact with the system
 actors initiate use cases and receive the outcomes

use cases
specific things your system can do.
“Place Order,” “Track Delivery,” or “Update Product Information”. Use cases are represented by ovals.

system boundary
The system boundary is a visual representation of the scope or limits of the system you are modeling. It defines what is inside the system and what is outside. The boundary helps to establish a clear distinction between the elements that are part of the system and those that are external to it. The system boundary is typically represented by a rectangular box that surrounds all the use cases of the system.

relationship
relationships play a crucial role in depicting the interactions between actors and use cases.
1.Association Relationship
	In simple terms, the Association Relationship in a Use Case Diagram is like drawing a line between an actor (like a user) and 	a task (use case) to show that the user is involved in or interacts with that specific task. It's a way of visually connecting 	who does what in a system.
2. Include Relationship
	The Include Relationship indicates that a use case includes the functionality of another use case. It is denoted by a dashed 	arrow pointing from the including use case to the included use case. This relationship promotes modular and reusable design.

3.extended
	The Extend Relationship illustrates that a use case can be extended by another use case under specific conditions. It is 	represented by a dashed arrow with the keyword “extend.” This relationship is useful for handling optional or exceptional 	behavior.

generalised
	The Generalization Relationship establishes an “is-a” connection between two use cases, indicating that one use case is a specialized version of another. It is represented by an 	arrow pointing from the specialized use case to the general use case.
